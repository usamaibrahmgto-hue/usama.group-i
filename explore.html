<h1>NATIONAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT (NRM)</h1>
    <p>
      National Resistance Movement was founded as a Liberation Movement that
      waged a successful protracted people's struggle that liberated Uganda from
      fascist and dictatorial regimes. The National Resistance Movement restored
      political stability, respect for human rights, national unity, peace,
      security, law and order, Constitutionalism and the rule of law; NRM
      launched and executed a minimum economic recovery programme through
      rehabilitation and development of socio-economic infrastructure, reduction
      and control of inflation, promotion of local and foreign investment,
      promotion of private sector led growth and export oriented production; The
      National Resistance Movement introduced democracy and enfranchised the
      people of Uganda through restoration of the vote in regular, free and fair
      elections; National Resistance Movement politically empowered previously
      marginalized sections of our society, namely women, youth, elders, people
      with disabilities and workers to play their rightful role in management of
      public affairs: National Resistance Movement established participatory
      democracy through a policy of decentralisation and self-governance through
      local councils, leading to political empowerment of the people and social
      harmony; National Resistance Movement established and operated the
      Movement Political System, that enhanced the people's participation in the
      political, social and economic development of the country;

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      The vision of NRM is a peaceful, united, democratic, harmonious,
      industrialised, transformed and prosperous Uganda within a strong and
      united Africa.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      The Mission of NRM is to transform Uganda from a poor peasant society into
      a modern, industrial, united and prosperous society. NRM is a national,
      broad based, inclusive, democratic, non-sectarian, multi-ideological,
      multi-interest and progressive mass organisation. In pursuit of its aims
      and objectives, NRM is guided by, but not limited to, the following
      principles:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Pursuit of peace;</li>
      <li>Democracy and good governance;</li>
      <li>National unity and non-sectarianism;</li>
      <li>Affirmative action</li>
      <li>Equal opportunities</li>
      <li>Patriotism</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Further, the principles of transparency, accountability, integrity,
      consensus building and merit are a basis for accessing positions of
      leadership within the organs of NRM.
